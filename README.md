# KronoX Converter

Does your university or school use KronoX as their primary
 scheduling app? Do you think it's poorly structured and 
 cluttered with uneccessary information? Personally I can't 
 stand it, so for two terms I manually created spreadsheets 
 in Google Sheets which included only the neccessary 
 information. But I got tired of it, and had an idea... What 
 if I could create a little application which, provided a 
 KronoX schedule, generates a nice and tidy spreadsheet 
 schedule for me?

KronoX Converter is a free open-source console application
 written in C#, which does just that.
